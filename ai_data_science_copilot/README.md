#  AI-Powered Data Science Copilot (Domain-Specific AutoML)

An **AI-powered AutoML system** that allows users to upload a dataset (CSV) + a natural language prompt (e.g., *“predict customer churn”*).  
The system automatically:
- Cleans and preprocesses the data
- Selects appropriate ML algorithms
- Tunes hyperparameters
- Trains and evaluates models
- Generates insights with visualizations
- Produces a **Streamlit dashboard + downloadable report**

## Features
-  **Automated Data Preprocessing** → Handles missing values, encoding, scaling
-  **Smart Model Selection** → Detects classification/regression and tests multiple algorithms
-  **Hyperparameter Optimization** → Uses Optuna for efficient tuning
-  **Interactive Dashboard** → Streamlit app for data upload, EDA, model results, and insights
-  **Explainability** → SHAP for feature importance and business insights
-  **Reporting** → Automated report generation (charts + metrics)
